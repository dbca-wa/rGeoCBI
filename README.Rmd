rGeoCBI in a nutshell:

* [OpenDataKit](https://opendatakit.org/) forms to evaluate a burnt site.
* Helpers to calculate the GeoCBI from the burn grading field data.
* Instructions to get up and running with digital data capture and data anlysis.
* Working examples of the entire data flow.

## What
To evaluate the severity of burns, the differential normalised burn ratio (dNBR)
of a burnt site can be derived from satellite imagery 
cost-effectively and on a large scale. 
To calibrate the dNDVI, ground truthing field work can derive an index
called "GeoCBI" from the condition and composition of a burnt site.

rGeoCBI contains background, digital data capture, analysis, and
visualisation for the calculation of GeoCBI, a composite burn index
for the initial assessment of the short-term burn severity from
remotely sensed data.

The GeoCBI was first described in

The GeoCBI we use here was further modified to suit Australian vegetation 
communities by Valerie Densmore at DBCA in Western Australia. 
This version of the GeoCBI is currently being tested and validated so the 
current version may not reflect the final form. Feedback on the use and validity 
of the Australian GeoCBI is welcome as 
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/dbca-wa/rGeoCBI/issues).


## How

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
remotes::install_github("dbca-wa/rGeoCBI")
```

`rGeoCBI` supplies an Xform to capture data digitally using OpenDataKit, then
goes on to access the data directly from R using the package `ruODK`, and
provides helper methods to calculate the GeoCBI from the captured data.

The overall data flow is described at 
[ruODK](https://dbca-wa.github.io/ruODK/index.html).

Read vignette 
[Digital Data Capture](https://dbca-wa.github.io/rGeoCBI/articles/forms.html) on
the design and setup of the digital data capture form and infrastructure.

[Data analysis](https://dbca-wa.github.io/rGeoCBI/articles/analysis.html) on
access, analysis, and visualisation of the captured burn grading data using 
the GeoCBI assessment method.

## Who
`rGeoCBI` was developed, and is maintained, by Florian Mayer for the Western Australian 
[Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DBCA)](https://www.dbca.wa.gov.au/).
