This vignette provides background and transparency for the digital data capture
of burn grading surveys.

## Creating the data capture form

* Design form in [ODK Build](https://build.opendatakit.org/)
* Include form (XML) in this package
* Deploy form to an ODK Central server, e.g. the 
  [DBCA ODK Central server](https://odkcentral.dbca.wa.gov.au/#/projects/2)

## Setting up a data capture device

* Install [ODK Collect from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.odk.collect.android) 
  onto an Android tablet and from Admin settings > Import settings, 
  scan the QR code shown here. This configures the tablet to our DBCA server.
* "Delete saved form" > "Blank forms" > delete older form versions.
* "Get blank form" and select the form "Burn Grading".
* Adjust settings to taste - auto-upload data in WiFi, optimise camera 
  resolution between clarity and file size.

## Capture data

* Follow the protocol on how to collect data.
* Consult the 
  [ODK Collect user guide](https://docs.opendatakit.org/collect-intro/) 
  on how to use the app in general.
* Nitpick: Aim to take all photos in landscape orientation (turn tablet 
  sideways), as this displays nicer on computer screens and in documents.
  
## Upload data

* Adjust ODK Collect settings to auto-upload data where WiFi is available.
* Bring the tablets into an area with WiFi.
